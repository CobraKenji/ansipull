# Ansipull

There is very little good information out there on how to set up ansible pull. I put this together as a better practice than what I have seen in other online examples.

Add your hosts and groups to the hosts file and add roles to your hosts in the local.yml file. This method can be made more scalable using Ansible's [Dynamic Inventory](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_dynamic_inventory.html).

## TODO
* Improve documentation
